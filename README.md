- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on iOS, Android, and web via Expo

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

### Frontend (React Native + Expo)

- **React Native 0.76.6** with Expo SDK 52
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **NativeWind** (Tailwind CSS for React Native)
- **React Navigation** for screen routing
- **Firebase SDK** for authentication and real-time data

### Backend (Python Flask)

- **Flask 3.1.0** web framework
- **Google Cloud Vision API** for image analysis

- **Daily.co API** for video calling

### Database & Services

- **Firebase Firestore** for recipe and user data
- **Firebase Authentication** for secure user management
- **Firebase Storage** for image uploads
- **Unsplash API** for recipe photography

## Challenges Encountered

- **Image Compression**: with generation times over 3 minutes long, we realized our images were being processed at to high of a quality
  - To solve this, we added an intermediary processing stage to compress the image, speeding up the process exponentially
- **LLM Inaccuracy**: with creative recipes of plastic salad and laptop toast, our OpenAI responses were highly inconsistent for our goals.
  - To solve this, we refined our prompt by providing more specific instructions, examples, and iterative refinement
